Work product for the Module 3 challenge

This repository contains the items required for submitting the Module 3 python challenge.

I received some help on the logic from the instructor and used ChatGPT to help with the .txt file exporting. The work was otherwise completely original.

The work follows the requirements listed in the Module 3 page on Bootcamp Spot
